# Wallpaper Changer
## A script written in Go to change the wallpaper according to the day of the week

### Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your Go source code file.

### Run the go build command to compile the program into an executable. For example, if your source code file is named wallpaper.go, run the following command:
go build wallpaper.go


### This will create an executable file named wallpaper.exe in the same directory.

### Create a shortcut to the wallpaper.exe file by right-clicking on the file, selecting "Create shortcut", and then moving the shortcut to a convenient location.

### Open the Startup folder by pressing the Windows key + R, typing "shell:startup", and pressing Enter.

### Move the shortcut to the Startup folder. This will make the program run automatically when Windows starts up.
